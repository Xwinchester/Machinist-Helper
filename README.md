# Machinist-Helper
This is a small app that visualizes data for programming cnc machines. Common data that I have to normally look up, will now all be in one place.
Currently setup to store the following:
- Thread data like the drill size, minor diameter, and required chamfer sizes.
- Specialized codes for certain machines. 
- Standard formulas that machinists need.
- Mass create folders in selected file path.
- Reference to a drill chart made in HTML & CSS

All data is stored in a json file.
